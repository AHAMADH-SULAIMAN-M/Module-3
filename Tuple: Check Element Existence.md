# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program

```python

x = (2,5,3,6,8,'a','g','e','h','b')

r1 = 8 in x
r2 = 'n' in x

print("8:",r1)
print("n:",r2)


```

## Result
The python program that checks if the element 'n and the element '8' exist within a given tuple is executed Successfully and verified.
